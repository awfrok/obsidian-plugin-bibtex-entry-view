The main focus of the article is on the concept of identity in social psychology and the social identity perspective specifcially. The psychological group and social identity processes are outlined along with the conditions that explain which of many identities (self-other similarity, self-stereotyping) will become salient. As part of this endeavor social identifciation and social identity salience are differentiated and implications for measurement are outlined. It is argued that social identity – the context specifci defniitions of who ‘we’ are and what ‘we’ do – both shape behavior and facilitate behavior change.},

- If the plugin find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock (first codeblock above) is replaced with the entry view of the `bibkey` (second codeblock).
- If the plugin cannot find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock remains same with red colored text and canceled line (third codeblock).


## what it does

- In the first line,
  - it shows the `bibkey` in the accent color of obsidian.
- In the second line,
  - If the bibtexentry has an author field, it shows the author field and its value right after the `bibkey`.
  - If the bibtexentry does not have an author field but a editor field, it shows the editor field and its value right after the `bibkey`.
- In the third line,
  - it shows `year`.
- In the fourth line,
  - it shows `entrytype`.
- In the fifth line and so on,
  - it sorts all the other fields and their values, and shows them.
  - In this step, it hides a few fields and their values, such as `abstract`, `creationdate`, `modificationdate`, `citationkey`, `language`, `keywords`.

## so, how a user can use it

### what a user need to do before use it

- Put the `.bib` file in the root of the vault. 
- Or, make a symbolic link to the `.bib` file in the root of the vault.

### in the note

- Write a codeblock in the following format
````
```bibkey
{bibkey}
```
````

### in the settings 

- And, in the settings of the plugin, you can choose the `.bib` file of the symbolic link to the `.bib` file.

## what it does not do regarding security

- It does not connect to internet.
- It does not access anything outside of the vault. This is the reason why a user need to copy the need `.bib` file into the vault or at least make a symbolic link to it in the vault.
