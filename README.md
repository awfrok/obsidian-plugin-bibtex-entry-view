The main focus of the article is on the concept of identity in social psychology and the social identity perspective specifcially. The psychological group and social identity processes are outlined along with the conditions that explain which of many identities (self-other similarity, self-stereotyping) will become salient. As part of this endeavor social identifciation and social identity salience are differentiated and implications for measurement are outlined. It is argued that social identity – the context specifci defniitions of who ‘we’ are and what ‘we’ do – both shape behavior and facilitate behavior change.},

- If the plugin find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock (first codeblock above) is replaced with the entry view of the `bibkey` (second codeblock).
- If the plugin cannot find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock is rendered in red colored text and canceled line (third codeblock).

## what it renders in the codeblock

- In the first line,
  - it shows the `bibkey` in the accent color of obsidian.
- In the second line,
  - If the bibtexentry has `author` field, it shows the author field name and its value right after the `bibkey`.
  - If the bibtexentry does not have `author` field but an `editor` field, it shows the editor field name and its value right after the `bibkey`.
  - All kinds of name are in "last, first ..." format. (v. 0.2.2)
- In the third line and so on,
  - it sorts all the other field names and their values by the order of `fields to display and sort` in the `settings` and shows them.

## so, how a user can use it

### before use it

- Put the `.bib` file in the root of the vault. 
- Or, import one in the settings.
- Or, make a symbolic link to user's own `.bib` file in the root of the vault.

### `settings` tab example

![settings.png](settings.png)

### choose a `.bib` file

- Initially, the current `.bib` file is empty.
- A user needs to choose the `.bib` file or the symbolic link in the vault.
- Or, a user can import a `.bib` file from outside the vault into the vault. 
  - Beware: This will overwrite any file that has the same name in the vault.

### customize rendering

- A user can choose fields and their order to render.

### in a note

- Write a codeblock in the following format

````
```bibkey
{bibkey}
```
````

- Suggested list will be shown while typing `{bibkey}` as follows. (v. 0.2.0)
  - The keywords for suggestion should be partial value of any `fields to display and sort` in the `settings`. (v. 0.2.1)

## known bug or malfunctioning

- It seems that the plugin does not show suggestions irregularly when using a plugin `Various Complements`. Looking into this problem. (@ v. 0.2.0)

## what is planned to add next

- adding a command to manually update the entry indicies when updating the target `.bib` file of the symbolic link.
- fuzzy search for autocompletion suggestion
