The main focus of the article is on the concept of identity in social psychology and the social identity perspective specifcially. The psychological group and social identity processes are outlined along with the conditions that explain which of many identities (self-other similarity, self-stereotyping) will become salient. As part of this endeavor social identifciation and social identity salience are differentiated and implications for measurement are outlined. It is argued that social identity – the context specifci defniitions of who ‘we’ are and what ‘we’ do – both shape behavior and facilitate behavior change.},

- If the plugin find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock (first codeblock above) is replaced with the entry view of the `bibkey` (second codeblock).
- If the plugin cannot find the `bibkey` in the `.bib` file, the codeblock is rendered in red colored text and canceled line (third codeblock).

## what it renders in the codeblock

- In the first line,
  - it shows the `bibkey` in the accent color of obsidian.
- In the second line,
  - If the bibtexentry has an author field, it shows the author field and its value right after the `bibkey`.
  - If the bibtexentry does not have an author field but a editor field, it shows the editor field and its value right after the `bibkey`.
- In the third line and so on,
  - it sorts all the other fields and their values by the order of `settings` and shows them.
  - In this step, it hides a few fields and their values that are chosen in `settings`.

## so, how a user can use it

### before use it

- Put the `.bib` file in the root of the vault. 
- Or, import one in the settings.
- Or, make a symbolic link to user's own `.bib` file in the root of the vault.

### in the `settings` 

![settings.png](settings.png)

#### choose a `.bib` file

- Initially, the current `.bib` file is empty.
- A user needs to choose the `.bib` file or the symbolic link in the vault.
- Or, a user can import a `.bib` file from outside the vault into the vault. 
  - Beware: This will overwrite any file that has the same name in the vault.

#### customize rendering

- A user can choose fields and their order to render.

### in a note

- Write a codeblock in the following format
````
```bibkey
{bibkey}
```
````
- Suggested list will be shown while typing `{bibkey}` as follows. (v. 0.2.0)
  - The keywords for suggestion should be part of `bibkey`, `author`, `editor`, `year`, `title`, `subtitle`, `booktitel`, `booksubtitle`.

## known bugs or malfunctioning

- It seems that the plugin does not show suggestions when using a plugin `Various Complements`. Looking into this problem. (@ v 0.2.0)

## what is planned to add next

- rendering `author` or `editor` field by the order of last, first, and middle.
- immediate rendering triggered on the option change.
- adding a command to manually update the entry indicies when updating the target `.bib` file of the symbolic link.
